List are set up as different structures than arrays

An Array is a contiguous data structure
Arrays can also be homogenous or heterogenous depending on the coding language.

 Data Structure Operations should be set up for:
 -Accessing and reading values
 -Searching for an arbitrary values
 -Need to be able to easily add values
 -Need to be able to easily delete values


 Append Operations
 -Are constant time functions

 Insert Operation
 -Needs to shift everything to the right


 Extend Operations
 -pass in new lists entirely
 -takes another list to add
 -essentially makes a series of appending calls

 Delete Operations
 -Shift items out and move them to the left
